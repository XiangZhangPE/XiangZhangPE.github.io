  abstract = {This paper proposed a symmetrical discrete coupling array (DCIArray) structure for multiphase interleaved DCDC converter. Firstly, a magnetics modeling based on reluctance and mutual-inductance is discussed with analysis on both equivalent time-interval inductance and small signal dynamic model. Then, matrix-type coupling implementation of the coupled structure is investigated. Simulation based on Finite Element Software and experiments on a four-phase buck converter has verified the effectiveness of proposed structure.},
